Check correctness of power tools G*Power, Webpower and Superpower via custom simulation of 2x2 between-subjects ANOVA interaction effect

simulation conditions: 
- different interaction designs (ordinal, hybrid, disordinal)
- different balancing of n (see matrices.R)
- different sample sizes (for plotting power curve: 20:260)
